    <h3>Amplify your burger with this creamy concoction!</h3>
    <p>This recipe stemmed from my exploration of smash burgers. I knew something was missing when I made them... But what?</p>
    <p>The sauce! No matter what I did, I neglected the most important thing. If you don't have a good sauce, your burger will be lackluster.</p>
    <p>Give this one a shot. You won't regret it.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 of a small onion, grated</li>
        <li>Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>Kewpie Mayo</li>
        <li>Hot Sauce</li>
        <li>Yellow Mustard</li>
        <li>Ketchup</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start the base of your sauce with a majority of it being kewpie mayo, place in bowl</li>
        <li>Add hot sauce, to taste</li>
        <li>Add a light amount of Worcestershire sauce. The more you add, the more smokey.</li>
        <li>Add a small amount of mustard, to taste. The more you add, the more tart.</li>
        <li>(optional) Add a light amount of ketchup if you like your sauce on the sweeter end.</li>
        <li>Grate your 1/4 onion finely, where its almost all juice and a lump of onion into the sauce.</li>
        <li>Stir ingredients together, adjust to taste as needed. <strong>Can be stored in the fridge for as long as your mayo lasts!</strong></li>
    </ol>
