The odin project "recipes"
Building a basic recipes website
- Main Index page
- Links to Pages
- See "Reflections and My Own Implementations" below

Reflections and My Own Implementations:
- Learned how to implement a home link for each page to take the user back to the index, improving user experience. No annoyance in having to hit the back button in browser
- Utilizing the proper list type for the application (ordered vs unordered)
- Ability to craft web pages from scratch utilizing html5
- Referencing images to properly display and manipulate their size to fit the wire frame for most desktops
- Implemented reference links to other pages of the site in my index (the individual recipes)
- Had some fun in adding custom artwork to give the user some amusement/entertainment when viewing the home page
- Using the appropriate headings tags for various sections of the page
- Using paragraph tags when necessary to create proper spacing of new lines
- Understanding the importance of alt text for accessibility
- Paying special attention to paths to my files so they are referenced currently
